# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
How to start online-course-app test environment

Start the Server: First, make sure your MySQL server is running. Then, start your Express server by running node server.js in your terminal. Make sure there are no errors in the console.

Start the React App: In a separate terminal window, navigate to your React app directory and start it using npm start or yarn start. This should open your app in a web browser.

to connect SQL Shell
TYPE

 MySQL  JS > '\connect your_username@localhost'

to change to out of js into sql

\sql

to show the tables in the db

show tables;

Now to view the table

Run the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM mysql.table_name;

This query will return all of the users in the MySQL user table.

To check for a specific user, you can use the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE user='username';

Replace username with the name of the user you want to check.

To filter the results, you can use the WHERE clause to specify the columns you want to return. For example, the following query will return the username, host, and password for all users:

SELECT user, host, password FROM mysql.user;
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
